**AI concepts explained like you're teaching a baby.**

## The Story
I built my first AI project using libraries without understanding what was happening inside.
The code worked.
I sounded smart.
Until someone asked *why*.

So I created **babyai**.

This library explains AI concepts the way humans understand them —
through life stories, not formulas.

## Philosophy
- No scary math exposed
- Real AI under the hood
- Human-friendly function names

## Example
```python
import babyai

model = babyai.birth_model(input_size=2)
babyai.teach(model, X, y)

print(babyai.how_wrong(model, X, y))
print(babyai.guess(model, new_data))
```

## Concept Mapping
| babyai | Real AI |
|------|---------|
| birth_model | Initialization |
| teach | Training |
| how_wrong | Loss |
| adjust_direction | Gradient Descent |
| guess | Inference |
| is_memorizing | Overfitting |

## Why this exists
Because AI isn't hard.
Bad explanations are.

Built by a student who learned AI the survival way.
